Rock Paper Scissors project from odin foundations

started 12/21/2022

OK, I'm starting this out in journal format.  This repository is
where I'm working on a javaScript rock-scissors-paper game.

I'm not really sure where we're going but as I understand the assignment,
we will, for this iteration, play on the console. I need to double check,
because I can't trust my memory.

It's good I checked.  The assignment is more detailed. First is to write
a function, getComputerChoice() that randomly returns one of rock paper scissors.  So that happens first. Now to research random in js.
math.random  between 0 and 1. Sorry, that's Math.random -- capitalize.
